# ORPIT
ORPIT is a Matlab toolbox containing all the necessary functions in order to calculate vector lattices, options replication and the minimum-cost insured portfolio in incomplete markets. ORPIT standing for "Option Replication and Portfolio Insurance Toolbox". The package was developed by V.N. Katsikis and S.D. Mourtas. If you use the Option Replication and Portfolio Insurance Toolbox in your research, please kindly cite the following paper:
* V.N. Katsikis, S.D. Mourtas, "ORPIT: a Matlab Toolbox for Option Replication and Portfolio Insurance in Incomplete Markets", Computational Economics, 56 (4), 711-721 (2020)

# Documentation
For usability and user experience, ORPIT has its own website. Detailed explanations on the theory background, the algorithmic procedure and a complete GUI tutorial can be found in the ORPIT's website: https://sites.google.com/view/orpit/. 
The website comprises all the necessary theory background of the tenMatlab functions included in ORPIT in detail as well as the algorithmic procedures of them. It offers an installation guide for the toolbox, a complete user manual of the GUI and a variety of implementations.

# Installation
*	Unzip the file you just downloaded and copy the ORPIT directory to a location,e.g.,/my-directory/
*	The toolbox "inference with classifiers" must be downloaded and copied to the ORPIT directory. This toolbox can be found here: https://github.com/emanuele/inference_with_classifiers
*	Run Matlab/ Octave, Go to /my-directory/ORPIT/ at the command prompt
*	Type the command "guitool" at the command prompt (Matlab/Octave)

# Environment
ORPIT has been tested in Matlab 2016a on OS: Windows 10 64-bit.
